  My name is Karim El-Husseiny from Cairo, Egypt. I am an entrepreneur who passionate about Web, Education and Efficiency. I love to write well-tested clean code which follows best practice and achieves highest performance. I specialise in Ruby and Javascript development (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra & AngularJS). Also I do like to design responsive UIs using modern CSS frameworks, and very interested in acronyms like TDD, OOD and DevOps.
